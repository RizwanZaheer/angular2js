Most likely you need to download and include the TypeScript definition file for jQuery—jquery.d.ts—in your project

You can download it here(https://github.com/typings/typings), or you can use typings(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/master/jquery/jquery.d.ts):

// 1. Install typings
npm install typings -g
// 2. Download jquery.d.ts (run this command in the root dir of your project)
typings install dt~jquery --global --save
